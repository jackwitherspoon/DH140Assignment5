The notebook in this repository is a copy of my Week 5 assignmemnt in which I look into the Finance dataset from Corgis. In the notebook, I import the data set using requests and Beautiful soup in order to do some webscrapping the access to access the webpage with the AIDS data. Once I create a function to access the webpage and data, I make a lineplot, a bar plot and histogram plot of the respective data. the purpose of this assignment was to learn how to scrap data from the web using Python.
